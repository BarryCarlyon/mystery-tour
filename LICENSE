MYSTERY TOUR LICENSE v1

You may copy, distribute and modify the software as long as you track changes/dates of in source files 
and keep modifications under this license. You can distribute your application using this software commercially. 
If you modify the software you must make available these changes. The modified software sources must be published
within 24 hours of the modification. Software can be used and downloaded freely without the need to publish or
distribute the code, but once the software has been modified this must be shared under the same terms of the license.
Any file within the repository can be modified except this license. The name of the repository should stay the same 
although if it changes, a link to the original repository, however, must be given (Github forking is sufficient to keep 
this link). For example - within Github - if you want to change this software simply fork the project and modify it. 
You are not allowed to clone the software and modify it without sharing these modifications within 24 hours of the
modification being created. Files generated by the software, and files such as configuration files which the user can 
copy and adapt are exempt from the requirement to publish the modifications.

The spirit of the license is such: To create a mystery tour of software that shares and evolves and is linked to each other.
It shouldn't be possible for someone to work on software in this repository in isolation - ideally it's about software 
changing, improving, mutating but always linked, forked, networked.
