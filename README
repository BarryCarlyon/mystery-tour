Mystery Tour

See the LICENSE

You can change any file (including this one) in this repository except the LICENSE file. If you add, delete or modify any file then you MUST commit and push your changes back to your repository within 24 hours. 

Simple - fork this project. Change some code. Push your changes within 24 hours.

Rinse and repeat for other people and you get a magical mystery tour of code within the network of github repositories.

Things like user created config files, or files that the software generates themselves are exempt from inclusion in the repository - but these are the types of files that are often not in normal repos.

Have a great trip!
